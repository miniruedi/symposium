{We present data from gas measurements in air and water conducted with the Omnistar, a commercially available mobile mass spectrometer by Pfeiffer Vacuum. Over the years, several MiniRuedi-inspired changes and improvements were made to the system by our group to make the Omnistar available for measurements in water as a GE-MIMS and to reduce fractionation processes. We would be happy to discuss potential and limitations of the Omnistar and receive input for improvements from more experienced GE-MIMS users.}
