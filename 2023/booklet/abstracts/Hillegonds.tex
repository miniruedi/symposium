{Assessment of bulk gas content in gas samples collected in copper tubes and returned to the laboratory for noble gas isotope analysis will be presented.  These measurements provide insight into the performance of the miniRUEDI instrumentation where inlet pressure is low and variable, helping to establish a pathway towards wider application of a capillary inlet mass spectrometry system within a noble gas mass spectrometry laboratory. 
 
Measurements made on gas samples returned from Yellowstone National Park will be discussed.  We will also discuss the prospect of utilising the miniRUEDI to assess bulk gas content in field-collected water samples, with example analyses made with a modified version of our water extraction system.}
